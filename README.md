Study of High Rise Residential Buildings in Indian Cities
(A Case Study –Pune City)

Abstract—High-rise structures are also called “vertical
cities”, having the potential to decongest urban sprawl. Indian
cities are witnessing immense demographic expansion due to
migration from surrounding villages, leading to urban sprawl,
housing demand, rise in cost of land. Housing has developed
into an economy generating industry. Given this demand, while
high-rise residential structures have become a solution in the
metropolitan cities, they remain eluded in tier II cities in India.
Low-rise or mid-rise high-density dwelling types have
developed in these cities. A study of Pune city’s housing needs,
demands, market, and type of structures being built, reveal that
tall buildings of 11 floors are being developed on the city’s
urban fringe. Most of the high-rise projects remain as proposals.
An investigation in this case study reveal that high rise
structures are not preferred due to user perception of insecurity
in case of fire and high cost of the building. The paper aims at
studying the availability and use of fly ash in various
proportions, which can be used in Indian high-rise residential
buildings. The research paper indicates that fly ash concrete
can be used to reduce the cost of construction and has the
potential to minimize the damage caused due to high
temperature
